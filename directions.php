<u>Location:</u> Chariot Solutions 165 Indiana Ave. Suite 2 Fort Washington, PA 19034<br>
<u>Phone:</u> (215) 358-1780<br><br>

<b>DIRECTIONS BY TRAIN</b><br>
1. Ideally, let us know ahead of time when to pick you up at the station<br>
2. Take the R5 LANSDALE/DOYLESTOWN line to the Fort Washington stop
(Warning: there are two R5 lines -- don't take the thorndale/paoli one)<br>
3. Call when you get in if you can't find the person picking you up or
weren't able to arrange something ahead of time<br>
4. If you'd really rather walk, take the road out of the station that
goes directly away from the tracks, past the parking lots, up to a
stoplight.  Turn right at the stoplight onto Pennsylvania Avenue (you'll
want to cross at the light to get to the sidewalk).   Walk down
Pennslyvania, past the Commerce Avenue stoplight and then make the next
left into the office complex you see on your left.   We're in the back
on the right with a big sign that says "Chariot Solutions".<br><br>
<b>If you would like a ride from the train station please email
meara@alumni.princeton.edu beforehand so we can work things out, or call
(215) 358-1780 when you arrive and ask for Erin.</b><br><br><br>
<b>DIRECTIONS FROM THE PA TURNPIKE</b><br>
1. Get off at Exit 339 (old exit 26, Fort Washington/Rt 309).<br>
2. Go through the tolls and straight, underneath Rt. 309 onto
Pennsylvania Avenue (do not get on Rt. 309)<br>
3. After the 309 ramps, the road will bend a bit to the right<br>
4. Make the very first right, which is immediately after the first
building (technically this is Indiana Avenue, but you probably won't see
the street sign, and it looks more like an office complex than a road)
[Note: If you get to the Commerce Ave. stoplight, you went too far]<br>
5. We're the building in the back on the right with a side glass
entrance and a "Chariot Solutions" sign.<br><br>

<b>DIRECTIONS FROM 309 SOUTH</b><br>
1. Get off at the Fort Washington exit (after the PA Turnpike exit)<br>
2. Merge off of the exit ramp, go under 309, skip the entrance ramp, and
then make the first possible right (into an office complex).
[Note: If you get to the Commerce Ave. stoplight, you went too far]<br>
3. We're the building in the back on the right with a side glass
entrance and a "Chariot Solutions" sign.<br><br>

<b>DIRECTIONS FROM 309 NORTH</b><br>
1. Get off at the Fort Washington/Turnpike exit<br>
2. Stay left when the exit splits (i.e. do not get onto the Turnpike)<br>
3. After the stop sign, go straight and get to the right as soon as
 possible to make very first right (right after the first building on
your right).
[Note: If you get to the Commerce Ave. stoplight, you went too far]<br>
4. We're the building in the back on the right with a side glass
entrance and a "Chariot Solutions" sign.<br>
