<b>Are Men Welcome?</b><br><br>
Yes! If they come with a woman.<br><br>
We've found that many women (myself included!) are somewhat shy about coming to a meeting such as this alone, and that a lot of women get involved in linux with their boyfriend's encouragement. So girls, if you want to come but don't want to come alone, bring your fellows! Guys, if you know a girl who would benefit from our group, come along!<br><br>
